# CH-1 : First Project

This is my first data cleaning project.  
The dataset (`duplicate.json`) contains users and pages with some issues like:
- Users with no names
- Duplicate users and pages
- Friends lists containing repeated IDs
- Pages with same ID but different names

## Data Structure
- **Users** → have `id`, `name`, `friends`, and `liked_pages`
- **Pages** → have `id` and `name`

## Cleaning Goals
- Remove users with no name  
- Remove duplicates (same name or ID)  
- Remove repeated friend IDs  
- Remove duplicate pages
